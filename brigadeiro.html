</ul>


<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Add all the ingredients into a pan</li>
<li>Put it under low heat and stir it (preferably with a wooden spoon) it until it starts sticking to the bottom of the pan</li>

<h2>Closing remarks:</h2>

<p>Depending on how much brigadeiro you want to do, you&rsquo;ll have to add more or less of each ingredient, so be creative! Be careful with the chocolate powder, you definitely do not want to add too much of it!</p>
