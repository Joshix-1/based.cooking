<ul>
<li>‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 30 min</li>
<li>üç≥Cook time: 6 hours</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
<li>7 pears (quality doesn&rsquo;t matter, you can argue that overripe pears are better because they have more suggar content)</li>
<li>3 apples</li>
<li>a small handfull of dates, raisins, dried appricots or prunes (optional, you can experiment with these they can bring some nice flavors)</li>
<li>150 grams sugar</li>
<li>1 glass of water</li>
<li>find sieve or cheese cloth</li>
<li>glass jar</li>
</ul>


<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Wash the outside of the fruit with water and cut it in 8 medium sized pieces, you don&rsquo;t have to core or deseed the fruit everything can go in the pot.</li>
<li>Place the fruit in a large pan with a thick bottom so you get even heat, i suggest you place the pears on the bottom since they don&rsquo;t burn as fast, add the glass of water.</li>
<li>If you are using them add the dried fruits at this point.</li>
<li>Put the heat as low as you can get it and let it all slowly stew for 3 hours, stiring every now and then.</li>
<li>At this point you can boil your glass jars to sterilize them, place them on a clean, dry towel.</li>
<li>When the fruit is done cooking for 3 hours grab your sieve or cleese cloth and place it over a bowl, run your fruit through it until you have extracted all the clear liquid, you can discard the pulp.</li>
<li>Quickly rins the pot with water so its clean and add the fruit liquid back, put back on the stove.</li>
<li>Add the sugar, add a bit less sugar if you also used dried fruits.</li>
<li>Cook for another 2 hours, after that stir every so often, Be careful with the stirring if you stir too often it might caramelize too quickly.</li>
<li>After two to two and a halve hours your syrup should be nearly done</li>
<li>At this point its up to you on how thick you want your syrup to be, a good way to test the viscosity is to drop a little bit on a cold plate or your countertop to see how it is at room temperature.</li>
<li>when you are happy with the viscosity poor the syrup into your sterilized jars and immeadiatly seal them.</li>
</ol>
